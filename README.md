# Spectrum-Prediction-using-LSTM
This project explores a deep learning approach, specifically using LSTM networksâ€”for spectrum occupancy prediction in Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-assisted Device-to-Device (D2D) communication environments. The objective is to improve spectrum utilization and energy efficiency while maintaining interference constraints.
