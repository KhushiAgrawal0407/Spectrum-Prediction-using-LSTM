# üìå Overview

- This project explores spectrum occupancy prediction in Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, integrated with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) for improved efficiency in Device-to-Device (D2D) communication.

- The goal is to predict whether a spectrum channel will be idle (0) or busy (1) in upcoming time slots, enabling secondary users (SUs) to access the spectrum opportunistically without interfering with primary users (PUs).


# üöÄ Key Features

- Developed an LSTM-based model for spectrum occupancy prediction.

- Implemented synthetic spectrum data generation using a sliding window approach.

- Evaluated using metrics like Accuracy, MSE, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC, ROC curves.

- Compared LSTM performance with Random History Model (RHM) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM).

- Achieved 87% accuracy with minimal overfitting.

- System integrates:

  - RIS phase reconfiguration for improved SINR.

  - Energy Harvesting (EH) model with Harvest-Then-Transmit strategy.
